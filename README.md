## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
While trying to style the card border, i made used of the border-top-left and right on the image since the styling i made on the card only styled the card bottom.  This is a new css attribute that i learn. 


### Continued development

I will be build more on cards then mmigrate to web development
